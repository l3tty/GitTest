Basic Flow
Before you start editing pull down the changes 
- git pull --rebase //This gets all the changes that are in the repo

After you edit the changed you want to add them to the staging area for the commit
- git add PutFileNameHere 
You can also add things using the period. This adds all the files that are red when you do git status before using this command make sure you want to add all the files 
- git add .

Once all the changes are in staging you want to commit them
- git commit -m "Add your message here"

Once everyhting is ready to commit, you want to see if your friends have changed everything by getting any changes 
- git pull --rebase

Finally push your changes 
- git push
